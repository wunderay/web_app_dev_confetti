My classwork for the node and express classwork, MongoDB classwork, CRUD classwork, and User Authentication classwork.

The css seems to be having issue so if the page takes too long to load then hit the X on your refresh button. The functionality wasn't impacted according to my knowledge.

There are build errors with user authentication currently. Will be fixed soon.
