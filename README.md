# web_app_dev_confetti

Something is broken and I don't know what it is but the app doesn't connect to any client.

My classwork for the node and express classwork, MongoDB classwork, CRUD classwork, and User Authentication classwork.

The css seems to be having issue so if the page takes too long to load then hit the X on your refresh button. The functionality wasn't impacted according to my knowledge.
